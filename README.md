# PegaTrade
> ***This project was created in 2017 and has been depreciated since then.***

------------
This was a fully functional project with active members. However, I've decided not to pursue it any longer due to many different companies releasing the exact same thing. Plus, the demand died down after the cryptocurrency crash. It is now open source for anyone that may want to implement something like this in the future. As of now, it still works if you plug in the correct API for Coinmarketcap and set up a database of your own. <br />

**Project Info**<br />
PegaTrade is a cryptocurrency portfolio manager with several unique features. You’ll be able to add or import all of your trades from other exchanges (such as Bittrex, GDax, Binance, etc.) using both API and CSV files. You’ll also be able to import your holdings using just your public ethereum address. Once everything is imported, PegaTrade shows you your Profit/Loss in the selected currencies (USD, EUR, BTC, ETH). Not only that, but you can now also share this portfolio with anyone you choose to.
